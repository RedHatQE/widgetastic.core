**Making testing of UIs fantastic.**

Widgetastic is a Python library designed to abstract web UI widgets into a nice object-oriented layer.
This library includes the core classes and some basic widgets that are universal enough to exist in this
core repository.

Built on top of Microsoft's **Playwright**, Widgetastic provides a robust, modern approach to web UI automation
that handles the complexities of modern web applications while maintaining clean, readable test code.

.. note::
   This documentation covers widgetastic.core, the foundation library. For framework-specific widgets
   (like those for PatternFly, Bootstrap, etc.), check out the ecosystem of widgetastic extensions.

Quick Example
=============

.. code-block:: python

    from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
    from widgetastic.browser import Browser
    from widgetastic.widget import View, Text, TextInput, Button

    class LoginView(View):
        username = TextInput(name='username')
        password = TextInput(name='password')
        submit = Button('Log In')
        message = Text('.flash-message')

    # Initialize with Playwright
    with sync_playwright() as p:
        browser = p.chromium.launch()
        page = browser.new_page()
        wt_browser = Browser(page)

        # Use the view
        login = LoginView(wt_browser)
        login.fill({
            'username': 'admin',
            'password': 'secret'
        })
        login.submit.click()

        if login.message.is_displayed:
            print(f"Login result: {login.message.text}")
